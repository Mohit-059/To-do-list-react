# To-Do List React App

A simple and user-friendly To-Do List application built with React.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks with a single click or by pressing Enter. Tasks are saved in `localStorage` to persist after refresh.
- **Edit Tasks:** Modify tasks by double-clicking or clicking the edit icon.
- **Set Reminders:** Set reminders on tasks with a clock icon. Reminders persist in `localStorage` and wonâ€™t trigger if the task is deleted.
- **Smart Reminder Management:** Deleting a task removes its reminder automatically.
- **Mark as Done:** Mark tasks as done by checking their box, which removes them from the list.
- **Drag-and-Drop:** Reorder tasks by dragging them. Order saves automatically.
- **Clear All:** Use the bin icon to clear all tasks with confirmation.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks, reminders, and their order are saved to `localStorage`.
- **Styling:** Yellow background (#fff5cc), pink accents (#E80071), and purple highlights for a cohesive look.
